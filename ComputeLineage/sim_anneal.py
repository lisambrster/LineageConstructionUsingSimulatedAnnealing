# simulated-annealing optimiztion of cell-nucleus lineage forests to perform
# frame-to-frame tracking of dividing cell nuclei

# the lineage forest is represented by the following data structure:
#
# the forest is an instance of the Tracks class.  Tracks contains a
# sequence of frames (the Frame class) that correspond to time-slices
# (frames) of the 3d-plus-time microscopic images of the developing
# embryo.  each frame consists of a list of nuclei (class LinkedNucleus)
# that are annotated with their 3d centroids (locations) and their volumes.
# a LinkedNucleus can be annotated with additional properties after
# instantiation to provide further information for use by a custom cost
# function.  a given nucleus in one frame is linked to its daughter or
# daughters in the subsequent frame (as well as its mother in the preceding
# frame).
#
# the purpose of the simulated annealing algorithm is to choose these
# mother-daughter links "optimally" so that the resulting forest best
# tracks how the nuclei move and split over time.  it is a forest because
# each nucleus in the first frame gives rise to -- and is the root of -- an
# individual tree in the forest.
#
# the Tracks data structure requires certain properties to hold.  each Frame
# contains a fixed nmber of nuclei.  the nuclei-counts of the first and last
# Frames must be exact powers of two.  the nuclei-counts must not decrease
# as one moves through the Frames from first to last -- that is, nuclei may
# divide, but not disappear. last, every intervening power of two between
# those of the first and last Frames must appear in Tracks.  that is, for
# example, [4, 4, 8], [4, 5, 8], and [4, 8, 16] would be legal sets of nuclei
# counts, while [4, 5, 16] would not.  these constraints on the nuclei counts
# of a Tracks data structure are validated and enforced when Tracks is constructed.
# the simulated-annealing algorithm assumes and relies on these constraints during
# its operation.  the power-of-two conditions are part of the "balanced-forest"
# infrastructure (see below) and are not required when balanced-forest support
# is turned off (by instantiating Tracks with supportSplit = False).
#
# additionally, each LinkedNucleus is required to have one or two daughter
# nuclei (except for those in the last Frame) and each LinkedNucleus is
# required to have exactly one mother nucleus (except for those in the first
# frame).  Tracks is constructed to satisfy these constraints, and the
# simulated-annealing algorithm maintains these constraints as it relinks
# the LinkedNuclei.
#
# the constructor of Tracks takes a list of nuclei counts that is validated
# as described above.  it initializes the nuclei centroids and volumes to
# zero and one, respectively.  the expected usage is that an instance of
# Tracks will be constructed with the list of nuclei counts from the data
# set whose nuclei one wishes to track, and then one will iterate over the
# LinkedNucleus objects in Tracks, setting their centroids and volumes to
# values from the data set.  Tracks also takes a supportSplit constructor
# argument (defaults to True) that enables or disables balanced-forest support.
#
# the simulated-annealing algorithm is implemented in the anneal() function:
#
# anneal (tracks, epochs, startTemp, stopTemp, daughterCostFunc, splitWt, history)
#
# tracks is the Tracks data structure that anneal() seeks to optimize by
# relinking the nuclei, updating tracks in place.
#
# epochs is the number of "epochs" to run (see below).
#
# startTemp and stopTemp are the initial and final "temperatures" used in
# the annealing algorithm.  the temperature is reduced exponentially from
# startTemp to stopTemp over the course of the annelaing process (on a
# per-epoch basis).
#
# the cost to be minimzed is determined by daughterCostFunc and splitWt.
# daughterCostFunc returns the cost contributed by a mother and its daughter(s).
# splitWt is the weight in the total cost of the unbalanced-forest penalty.
# daughterCostFunc defaults to DefaultDaughterCostFunc instatiated with
# costParams = CostParams() with its default values.  (daughterCostFunction
# may be a function or an instance of a callable class.  the callable-class
# vearsion is illustrated by DefaultDaughterCostFunc.)
#
# costParams is the set of parameters (in a CostParams instance) that
# control the objective function (see below).  (although CostParams
# contains a splitWt property, splitWt must be passed to anneal() and
# the various cost functions separately from daughterCostFunction.)
#
# history specifies whether the evolution of the annealing process should
# be recorded (for testing and visualization purposes).
#
# discussion of the simulated-annealing algorithm:
#
# simulated annealing is an algorithm for minimizing an objective function
# (cost function) over a configuration space.  in our case, a point in
# configuration space is a proposed set of tracks, that is, the set of links
# in a Tracks data structure that link mother and daughter nuclei (subject
# to the linking constraints discussed above).  the configuration space is
# therefore the set of all (legal) candidate tracks.
#
# the cost function should be chosen to take on its minimum for the correct
# tracking, that is, for the set of links that maps each mother nucleus to its
# correct daughter nuclei in the next Frame.  if the algorithm successfully
# minimizes such a cost function, it will, by definintion, have constructed
# the correct set of tracks.
#
# our default cost function consists of three terms:  the first is the sum of
# squared deviations of the euclidean distances between the mother nuclei and their
# daughters from a target distance plus the sum of squared deviations of the
# euclidean distances between the two daughters from a target (when the mother
# splits).  these target distances are a hard-wired zero for the unsplit-mother-daughter
# distance and the CostParams properties centSplitMDDist and centSplitDDDist for
# split-mother-daughter and daughter-daughter distances, respectively.  the second
# is the squared mismatch between the volume of the mother nuclei and their daughters.
# if a nucleus splits into two daughters, the sum of the daughter volumes is matched
# against CostParams.volSplitMult times the mother volume, otherwise the volume of
# the single daughter is matched against CostParams.volNoSplitMult times the mother
# volume.  these first two terms depend only on a mother and its daughters and are
# computed by daughterCostFunc. the third term is the "split" or "unbalanced forest"
# penalty, enabled if supportSplit = True (the default), and is computed separately
# from the mother-daughter cost terms in tracksCost() and Tracks.deltaCost().

# specifically, the unbalanced-forest penalty is computed as follow:  the ancestor
# nuclei in one Frame with 2^n nuclei are each expected to have exactly two descendants
# in the subsequent "power-of-two" Frame that has 2^(n+1) nuclei.  the split penalty
# is then the square of the excess over two descendants that each power-of-two-Frame
# nucleus has in the subsequent power-of-two Frame, summed over all (except for the
# last frame) power-of-two-Frame nuclei.  (the frames in which the split penalty is
# calculated are flagged with splitRoot = True in the Frame class.)
#
# these three terms are combined togheter into a composite cost function with the
# weights CostParams.centWt and CostParams.volWt (when using DefaultDaughterCostFunc)
# and the splitWt passed to tracksCost() and Tracks.deltaCost().  (splitWt must be set
# to None when supportSplit = False.)  sub-terms of centroid and volume cost terms are
# further weighted with the finer-grained weights in CostParams.
#
# in typical usage, simulated annealing proceeds by randomly choosing a candidate
# move in configuration space from the current point, point A, to some new point,
# point B.  it is not necessary to condsider as a candidate moving from some point
# A to any other point, say point Z, in configuration space, but it must be possible
# to move from point A to point Z with a sequence of candidate moves.
#
# the probability of choosing A->B as a candidate is required to be the same
# as choosing B->A.  if the cost function at point B is lower than that at A,
# the candiate move is accepted.  if the cost function is higher, the candidate
# move is accepted with probability exp (-delta_cost / temperature), where
# delta_cost = cost (B) - cost (A).  if the candidate move is accepted, the
# point in configuration space is set to point B (otherwise it remains point A)
# and the process of randomly selecting and accepting / rejecting candidate moves
# is repeated.  this update process is biased to reduce the cost function -- all
# moves that decrease the cost are accepted -- but permits the algorithm to explore,
# in principle, all of configuration space, as cost-increasing moves can be accepted,
# but with exponentially decreasing probability, as the annealing temperature is
# decreased toward zero.
#
# simulated annealing is generally applied to problems where a point in configuration
# space is itself a complicated object -- not something as simple as, say, a single
# three-dimensional point.  this is true for our use case where a point in configuration
# space is the entire forest of linked nuclei.  because points in configuration space
# are complicated, it can be expensive to compute the cost function from scratch for
# some given point.  for this reason, proposed candidate moves are chosen to be in some
# sense "local."  specifically, point B should be obtained from point A by making a
# "small" change, and delta_cost should be able to be computed from that change, rather
# than by incurring the expense of computing the entire cost directly for point B.
#
# our candidate moves consist of swapping the mother links of two nuclei in a given
# frame.  that is, nucleus A is relinked to the mother of nucleus B and vice versa.
# we also include "half-swaps" as candidate moves where a daughter of a two-daughter
# mother is relinked to a one-daughter mother.  it is possible to move from any point
# in configuration space to any other with a sequence of such swap and half-swap moves.
#
# it is cheap to compute the centroid and volume contributions to delta_cost for such
# swap and half-swap moves -- it is only necessary to look at the two nuclei being
# swapped and their mothers.  computing the change in the "split" penalty (unbalanced
# forest penalty), however, is more involved, as the change to mothers' numbers of
# descendants must be propagated up to the preceding power-of-two Frame (where the
# split penalty is ultimately computed).  this is made more manageable by storing in
# each LinkedNucleus a kLeaf property that is the number of that nucleus's descendants
# in the subsequent power-of-two Frame.  kLeaf is initialized when Tracks is constructed,
# and updated (with the changes propagated up to the preceding power-of-two Frame) when
# a candidate move is accepted.  (kLeaf is also recomputed by tracksShuffle(), see below.)
#
# the balanced-forest condition -- that each power-of-two-Frame nucleus has exactly two
# descendants in the subsequent power-of-two Frame -- is not enforced as a constraint
# because our swap and half-swap moves would not be able move to all points in configuration
# space in the presence of such a constraint.  instead the balanced-forest condition is
# achieved via a sufficiently-heavily-weighted split penatly in the cost function.
#
# candidate moves are selected by randonly choosing a pair of same-frame nuclei to
# potentially swap -- half-swap candidates are indicated by a randomly chosen boolean
# value that only takes effect if one of the two mothers has one daughter and the
# other, two.  ignoring the half-swap modifier, there is a given number of possible
# candidate moves, namely, the number of same-frame pairs.  an epoch is defined (rather
# arbitrarily) as proposing (and then accepting or rejecting) a number of randomly
# chosen candidates equal to the number of same-frame pairs.  there is no implication
# that all same-frame pairs will be proposed in a epoch -- only that they all have
# the same random chance of being chosen.
#
# some utility and testing functions are:
#
# Tracks.computeKLeaf(): kLeaf is an internal property of LinkedNucleus that
# is used to keep track of the balanced-forest condition.  it depends on the
# mother-daughter links.  if you initialize the mother-daughter links in Tracks
# based on an external dataset (and are using supportSplit = True), you should
# call Tracks.computeKLeaf() to initialize the kLeaf values consitently with the
# links.
#
# Tracks.validate() verifies that Tracks satisfies the constraints described
# above.  because the simulated-annealing algorithm relinks the nuclei, it
# is used in testing to verify that the algorithm maintains the mother-daughter
# linking constraint.  (as a convenience, Tracks.validate (computeKLeaf = True) can
# be used to intialize kLeaf properly at validation time.)
#
# tracksCost (tracks, daughterCostFunc, splitWt) returns the value of the objective
# function for the current configuration of tracks.
#
# tracksInitRandom (tracks, ...) initializes the centroids and volumes in the
# LinkedNuclei in tracks with random values that follow (with random deviations)
# the mother-daughter relationships.  this is to generate random data sets with
# trackable structure for testing.
#
# tracksShuffle (tracks, ...) shuffles the links in tracks (respecting the
# mother-daughter linking constraints).  after running tracksInitRandom(), tracks
# is linked (approximately) optimally -- this provides (approximate) ground-truth
# tracks for the (randomly-generated) tracking problem.  tracksShuffle() then
# scrambles the links, providing an initialized but not-yet-tracked Tracks data
# structure for testing the tracking algorithm
